NOTE: This is work that was heavily borrowed from https://github.com/freethejazz which he did for Spantree.

The main modifications I made were to adjust the user management to be done via Auth0 instead of a custom token solution we had in place before.

Migrating to this repo to have the "complete" app in one location for easier forking/customization.

# Usage
Still a WIP right now.

Shrinkwrap configuration is based off of `npm install && npm prune --production`
